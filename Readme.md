<b>DonATE Android Application</b>

This is the final version of the <b>DonATE android application</b> made for our third year SDL project.

In order to make Places AutoComplete work, the <b>meta tag</b> in the <b>Android Manifest</b> needs to be updated. Change the text that says 
<b>"YOUR_API_KEY"</b> with the correct Google Places AutoComplete API KEY that has been shared with you.

The <b>"Take Photo"</b> option in the profile may not work on some phones.
This will be fixed soon.
